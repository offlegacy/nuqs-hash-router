> This package is not an official adapter of nuqs, and caution is advised when using it in production (especially in enterprise environments). (Although it's unofficial, I am actually using it successfully in a company project. Thanks to our team.)

This is a dedicated nuqs adapter for React Router's HashRouter. Currently, nuqs officially supports BrowserRouter, and support for HashRouter is still under discussion.

This package was created to enable the use of nuqs in applications that use React Router's HashRouter.

## Usage

### Installation

```shell
npm install @offlegacy/nuqs-hash-router
```

```tsx
import { NuqsAdapter } from '@offlegacy/nuqs-hash-router';
import { Outlet } from 'react-router';

// ...

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NuqsAdapter>
      <Outlet />
    </NuqsAdapter>
  );
}
```
